## Requirements
The codebase supports iOS and requires Xcode 12.0 or newer

## Installation
### Xcode
Open your project. Navigate to `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency`. Enter the url `https://github.com/ericlewis/BottomSheetView` and tap `Next`.
Select the `BottomSheetView` target and press `Add Package`.

### Swift Package Manager
Add the following line to the `dependencies` in your `Package.swift` file:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ericlewis/BottomSheetView.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
```
Next, add `BottomSheetView` as a dependency for your targets:
```swift
.target(name: "AppTarget", dependencies: ["BottomSheetView"])
```
A completed example may look like this:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "ExampleApp",
    dependencies: [
        .package(
          url: "https://github.com/ericlewis/BottomSheetView.git", 
          .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
          name: "ExampleAppTarget", 
          dependencies: ["BottomSheetView"])
    ]
)
```

## Examples
### Example Project
If you are using Xcode 13.2.1 you can navigate to the [`Example`](Example) folder and open the enclosed Swift App Playground to test various features (and see how they are implemented).

### Presentation
`BottomSheetView` works similarly to a typical [`sheet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/sheet(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)) view modifier.
```swift
import SwiftUI
import BottomSheetView

struct ContentView: View {
  @State
  private var sheetPresented = false
  
  var body: some View {
    Button("Open Sheet") {
      sheetPresented = true
    }
    .bottomSheet(isPresented: $sheetPresented) {
      Text("Hello!")
    }
  }
}
```

`BottomSheetView` also supports presentation via conditional `Identifiable` objects.
```swift
import SwiftUI
import BottomSheetView

struct ContentView: View {
  @State
  private var string: String?
  
  var body: some View {
    Button("Open Sheet") {
      string = "Hello!"
    }
    .bottomSheet(item: $string) { unwrappedString in
      Text(unwrappedString)
    }
  }
}

extension String: Identifiable {
  public var id: String { self }
}
```

### Customization
`BottomSheetView` can also be customized using a collection of view modifiers applied to the bottom sheet's content.
```swift
import SwiftUI
import BottomSheetView

struct ContentView: View {
  @State
  private var sheetPresented = false
  
  var body: some View {
    Button("Open Sheet") {
      sheetPresented = true
    }
    .bottomSheet(isPresented: $sheetPresented) {
      Text("Hello!")
        .prefersGrabberVisible(true) // Always applied to children, similar to navigation views.
    }
  }
}
```

## Documentation
#### Presentation
These are extensions on `View`.

```swift
/// Presents a sheet using `UISheetPresentationController` when a binding to a
/// Boolean value that you provide is true.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - isPresented: A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether
///     to present the sheet that you create in the modifier's
///     `content` closure.
///   - onDismiss: The closure to execute when dismissing the sheet.
///   - content: A closure that returns the content of the sheet.
public func bottomSheet<Content: View>(
  isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
  onDismiss: (() -> Void)? = nil,
  @ViewBuilder content builder: @escaping () -> Content
) -> some View
```

```swift
/// Presents a sheet via `UISheetPresentationController` using the given
/// item as a data source for the sheet's content.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - item: A binding to an optional source of truth for the sheet.
///     When `item` is non-`nil`, the system passes the item's content to
///     the modifier's closure. You display this content in a sheet that you
///     create that the system displays to the user. If `item` changes,
///     the system dismisses the sheet and replaces it with a new one
///     using the same process.
///   - onDismiss: The closure to execute when dismissing the sheet.
///   - content: A closure returning the content of the sheet.
public func bottomSheet<Item: Identifiable, Content: View>(
  item: Binding<Item?>,
  onDismiss: (() -> Void)? = nil,
  @ViewBuilder content builder: @escaping (Item) -> Content
) -> some View
```

#### Styling & Behavior
These are extensions on `View`, they apply preferences to `BottomSheetView`. The `ViewModifier`s themselves are not public.

```swift
/// The array of heights where a sheet can rest.
public func detents(_ detents: [UISheetPresentationController.Detent]) -> some View
```

```swift
/// The largest detent that doesnâ€™t dim the view underneath the sheet.
public func largestUndimmedDetentIdentifier(_ id: UISheetPresentationController.Detent.Identifier?) -> some View 
```

```swift
/// A Boolean value that determines whether scrolling expands the sheet to a larger detent.
public func prefersScrollingExpandsWhenScrolledToEdge(_ preference: Bool) -> some View 
```

```swift
/// A Boolean value that determines whether the sheet shows a grabber at the top.
public func prefersGrabberVisible(_ preference: Bool) -> some View
```

```swift
/// A Boolean value that determines whether the sheet attaches to the bottom edge of the screen in a compact-height size class.
public func prefersEdgeAttachedInCompactHeight(_ preference: Bool) -> some View
```

```swift
/// A Boolean value that determines whether the sheet's width matches its view controller's preferred content size.
public func widthFollowsPreferredContentSizeWhenEdgeAttached(_ preference: Bool) -> some View
```

```swift
/// The corner radius that the sheet attempts to present with.
public func preferredCornerRadius(_ preference: CGFloat?) -> some View
```

```swift
/// Conditionally prevents interactive dismissal of a popover or a sheet.
public func dismissDisabled(_ preference: Bool) -> some View
```

## Known Issues
- Largest undimmed detent changes seem to affect the dimming of accent color elements in parent views.
- Attempt to set a constant value for `item` or `isPresented` results in the sheet not being presented.
- Creating a bottom sheet & doing all layout work in the bottom sheet itself results in missing accent colors.
  - Workaround: instead, create a new `View` and use that in `.bottomSheet`
